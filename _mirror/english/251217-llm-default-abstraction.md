## Types of Conflicts 

Define:  a reasoning path $T=(P_1, P_2, P_3, \cdots, P_N)$ is a sequence of propositions where $ P_i \in \mathcal{P}$.

Define: Conflict of Paths: For two reasoning paths $T, T'$ with where $Cons(T)=Cons(T')$ 

- Self: When the initial proposition results in different conclusions of following propositions
- Simple: The
