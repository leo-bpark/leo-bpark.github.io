## 1. Deterministic vs. Nondeterministic Computation

A **deterministic** machine behaves like a normal computer:  
given an input and a current state, it has exactly one possible next action.  
It follows a single, predictable computation path.

A **nondeterministic** machine is a theoretical model that can  
*magically guess* a correct solution among many possibilities.  
If a valid witness exists, the machine chooses it instantly and then  
**verifies** it using a deterministic algorithm that must run in polynomial time.

This “guess + verify” idea is the foundation of the complexity class $~NP~$.



## 2. Polynomial-Time Computation: P and NP

Polynomial time refers to any running time of the form

$$
n^k \quad \text{for some constant } k.
$$

- **P** is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time on a deterministic machine.  
  These are considered “efficiently solvable.”

- **NP** is the class of problems whose solutions (called *witnesses*)  
  can be **verified** in polynomial time on a deterministic machine.  
  Equivalently, NP is the class solvable in polynomial time on a nondeterministic machine.

Because deterministic computation is weaker than nondeterministic guessing, we know:

$$
P \subseteq NP.
$$

Whether $~P = NP~$ or $~P \neq NP~$ is one of the most famous open problems in computer science.


## 3. Reductions and How Problems Become Equivalent

To compare the difficulty of two problems, we use **polynomial-time reductions**.

A problem $~A~$ reduces to a problem $~B~$ (written $~A \le_p B~$)  
if any instance of $~A~$ can be transformed into an instance of $~B~$  
in polynomial time such that solving $~B~$ solves $~A~$.

This gives us a formal notion of difficulty:

- If $~A \le_p B~$, then **$~B~$ is at least as hard as $~A~$**.  
- If two problems reduce to each other, they are **equivalent in complexity**.

This reduction idea is what allows us to define NP-complete problems.


## 4. NP-Complete Problems: The Hardest Problems in NP

A problem $~C~$ is **NP-complete** if:

1. $~C \in NP~$, and  
2. every NP problem reduces to $~C~$:

$$
\forall A \in NP,\; A \le_p C.
$$

This means NP-complete problems are the **hardest problems inside NP**.  
If any NP-complete problem is solved in polynomial time, then:

$$
P = NP.
$$

Examples include **SAT**, **3-SAT**, **Clique**, **Vertex Cover**,  
and **Traveling Salesman (decision version)**.

Even though these problems look very different,  
polynomial-time reductions show that they all have exactly the same computational difficulty.


## 5. PSPACE and PSPACE-Complete Problems

Above NP lies the larger class **PSPACE**,  
the class of problems solvable with **polynomial space** (memory),  
regardless of how much time is required.

A PSPACE algorithm may run for exponential time,  
as long as it reuses its space efficiently.

A problem is **PSPACE-complete** if:

1. it can be solved in polynomial space, and  
2. every PSPACE problem reduces to it.

The classic PSPACE-complete problem is **QBF**  
(Quantified Boolean Formula), which extends SAT by allowing  
alternating existential and universal quantifiers like $~\exists~$ and $~\forall~$.  
This creates a game-like logical structure that requires significantly more power to analyze.

PSPACE-complete problems are believed to be much harder than NP-complete problems.


## 6. Higher Levels Above PSPACE

Beyond PSPACE, there are even stronger complexity classes:

- **EXPTIME**: problems solvable in exponential time  
- **EXPSPACE**: exponential space  
- **Undecidable problems**: problems no algorithm can solve in general

Each class is believed to strictly contain the one below it (though some separations are unproven).


## 7. The Big Picture

Here is the widely believed hierarchy of complexity classes:

$$
P \subseteq NP \subseteq PSPACE \subseteq EXPTIME \subseteq EXPSPACE \subsetneq \text{Undecidable}.
$$

Inside NP:

$$
P \subseteq NP \supseteq \text{NP-complete}.
$$

- **P**: efficiently solvable  
- **NP**: efficiently verifiable  
- **NP-complete**: hardest problems inside NP  
- **PSPACE**: problems solvable with polynomial space  
- **PSPACE-complete**: hardest problems in PSPACE  
- **Higher classes**: even more powerful or even unsolvable problems

This provides the overall structure of classical complexity theory.
